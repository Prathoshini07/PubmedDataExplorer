## About the PubMed Website

[**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) is a free search engine that provides access to an extensive database of references and abstracts on biomedical and life sciences research. It is maintained by the **National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)** at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM).  

### Key Features of PubMed:  
- Hosts millions of citations for biomedical literature from various sources, including MEDLINE and scientific journals.  
- Provides metadata like article title, abstract, authors, journal details, publication date, and PubMed ID (PMID), which serves as a unique identifier for articles.  
- Facilitates search and access to research for academic, medical, and professional purposes.

## About the Project  

The **PubMed Data Explorer** application provides an intuitive platform for exploring PubMed data, powered by AI and clustering techniques. It integrates data scraping, clustering, and an interactive UI to enhance the experience of exploring biomedical literature.

## How the Application Works  

### Backend  
1. **Data Scraping**  
   - Articles from PubMed are scraped using their metadata and stored in a **MongoDB** database.  
   - Data fields include `pmid`, `title`, `abstract`, `authors`, `journal`, and `publication_date`.  

2. **MongoDB Integration**  
   - Data is retrieved dynamically from the MongoDB collection (`Datas`).  
   - The app queries articles by their PMIDs and supports clustering of titles.

### AI-Powered Insights  

1. **GPT-2 for Question Answering**  
   - The application uses **GPT-2**, a pre-trained **Generative Pre-trained Transformer** model by OpenAI, to answer user queries about a selected article.  
   - The abstract and title of the selected article provide the **context** for the question.  
   - GPT-2 generates responses based on its learned language patterns, providing meaningful answers.  

   **Why GPT-2?**  
   - GPT-2 is a highly versatile text-generation model capable of understanding and producing human-like text.  
   - While GPT-2 is not specifically fine-tuned for biomedical data, it is powerful enough to provide contextual responses from a general perspective.

2. **K-Means Clustering for Similar Articles**  
   - The **TF-IDF Vectorizer** converts article titles into numerical vectors based on term frequency and importance.  
   - **K-Means Clustering** groups articles into clusters based on title similarity, allowing users to discover similar research.

## Frontend  

The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, a Python library for creating interactive web apps. Key features include:  
- Dropdown selection for PubMed IDs.  
- Real-time display of article metadata like title, abstract, and authors.  
- Question-answering feature powered by GPT-2.  
- Display of similar articles based on clustering.  

The application is hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**, making it accessible at **[PubMed Data Explorer](https://qiksjvz4pbyyarzmevwog4.streamlit.app/)**.

## How to Use  

1. Open the app at [**PubMed Data Explorer**](https://qiksjvz4pbyyarzmevwog4.streamlit.app/).  
2. Select a PubMed ID (PMID) from the dropdown to load an article.  
3. View article details, including title, abstract, authors, and publication date.  
4. Ask a question about the article to get insights generated by GPT-2.  
5. Explore similar articles grouped by clustering.

## Benefits of the System  

- **Simplified Exploration**: Quickly access and analyze PubMed articles without manual searches.  
- **AI-Assisted Insights**: Get meaningful answers to questions about research articles.  
- **Discovery of Related Content**: Cluster-based grouping helps identify related research articles efficiently.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit ensures the application is user-friendly and highly interactive.
