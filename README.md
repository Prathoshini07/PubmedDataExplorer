# PubMed Data Explorer

PubMed Data Explorer is an AI-powered application that integrates PubMed data with machine learning techniques to provide users with insightful access to biomedical research articles. The platform leverages GPT-2 for answering user queries and K-Means clustering for finding similar articles, making it an interactive and innovative way to explore research literature.

## Features
- **Explore PubMed Articles**: Search for articles using their unique PubMed IDs (PMIDs).
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Ask questions about selected articles and receive intelligent responses generated by GPT-2.
- **Discover Similar Articles**: Find related articles using K-Means clustering based on the similarity of article titles.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## How It Works

### Backend
1. **Data Source**: The application scrapes article metadata from the [PubMed website](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and stores it in a MongoDB database.
2. **MongoDB Integration**: Articles are stored with fields such as PMID, title, abstract, authors, journal, and publication date for efficient querying and clustering.
3. **Hierarchical Metadata Clustering**:
   - An Excel sheet with metadata is used to associate PMIDs with clustering information.
   - This sheet contains columns:
     - `pmid`: Unique PubMed ID.
     - `lev1_cluster_id`, `lev2_cluster_id`, `lev3_cluster_id`, `lev4_cluster_id`: Hierarchical clustering levels grouping articles based on content similarity.
   - The clustering levels enable deeper analysis by allowing users to explore relationships among articles at different granularities.

### AI-Powered Features
1. **GPT-2 Integration**:
   - GPT-2, developed by OpenAI and accessed via the Hugging Face Transformers library, is used to answer user queries about selected articles.
   - Users provide a question and the context (article title and abstract), and GPT-2 generates relevant responses.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - The TF-IDF vectorizer transforms article titles into numerical representations.
   - K-Means clustering groups articles based on title similarity, enabling the discovery of related research papers.

### Frontend
- **Built with Streamlit**: Streamlit provides an interactive web app for real-time exploration of PubMed data.
- **Hosted on Streamlit Cloud**: Accessible at [PubMed Data Explorer](https://qiksjvz4pbyyarzmevwog4.streamlit.app/).

## How to Use
1. Open the app at [PubMed Data Explorer](https://qiksjvz4pbyyarzmevwog4.streamlit.app/).
2. Select a PubMed ID (PMID) from the dropdown menu to load article details.
3. View metadata, including the title, abstract, authors, and publication date.
4. Ask questions about the article to receive insights generated by GPT-2.
5. Discover similar articles based on K-Means clustering.

## Data Pipeline
1. **Scraping**: Articles are scraped from PubMed and stored in MongoDB.
2. **Metadata Clustering**: The metadata Excel sheet associates articles with hierarchical clustering levels.
3. **Clustering and AI**:
   - Articles are clustered using K-Means.
   - GPT-2 provides AI-driven answers to user queries.

## Dependencies
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `streamlit`: For the frontend.
  - `transformers`: For GPT-2 integration.
  - `sklearn`: For TF-IDF vectorization and K-Means clustering.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `pymongo`: For MongoDB integration.

## Hosting
The app is hosted on Streamlit Cloud, accessible at: [PubMed Data Explorer](https://qiksjvz4pbyyarzmevwog4.streamlit.app/).

## Future Enhancements
- Expand clustering to include abstracts and full-text data for deeper insights.
- Integrate advanced models fine-tuned on biomedical data, such as BioBERT.
- Allow custom filtering and searching based on hierarchical clustering levels.
